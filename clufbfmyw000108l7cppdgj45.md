By working together, Business Analysis and Process Management create a powerful synergy. Business Analysis provides the roadmap, identifying where we want to go (goals) and any potential obstacles (challenges). Process Management equips us with the perfect gear (optimized processes) to navigate the journey efficiently and effectively, ensuring we reach our destination.
